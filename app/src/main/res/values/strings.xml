        Sometimes this might happen even if your login and password are correct due a <b>F1 API BUG</b>.\n\n
        1. If that is the case a possible workaround is to <b>go to F1TV website on your computer</b>,
        then login on your account and logout then come
        back to the app and it will eventually work.\n
        2. It is also possible that for some reason your IP is blocked (401 response) in this case try
        to switch networks it might also work. In this case you have to reach F1 support as well.
